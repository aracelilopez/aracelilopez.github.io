My experience as a volunteer in social associations has been an enriching opportunity that has allowed me to contribute to important causes while learning about various aspects of society and its challenges. However, one aspect that has surprised me is the growing importance of technology and its use in the realm of social organizations.

When I began my volunteer work, my main focus was on activities such as childcare, organizing community events, and assisting those in need. But over time, I realized that social organizations and their members play a significant role in addressing the lack or dangers of misuse of technology, which can compromise their ability to help those who need it most.

Cybersecurity has become crucial in handling sensitive data, such as personal information of beneficiaries, financial details, and donor records. The lack of adequate cybersecurity measures can jeopardize the confidentiality and integrity of this information, which could have serious repercussions for both the organization and the people it serves.

So, as a volunteer, I got to work raising awareness about the importance of technology and cybersecurity in our associations. From talks about strong passwords to tips for detecting email scams, we worked hard to protect our systems and data.

Working as a team to strengthen our cybersecurity was quite an adventure and allowed me to combine my passion for technology with my social commitment. I discovered that cybersecurity is a concern that affects all organizations, regardless of their size or mission. In an increasingly digitized world, understanding and addressing these risks becomes essential to protect not only our interests but also those we serve.

As a volunteer, I feel grateful for the opportunity to make a difference in this important cause. And I'm excited to continue exploring the intersection between technology and social work in the future!
