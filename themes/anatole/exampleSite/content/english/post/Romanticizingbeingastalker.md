 "Every day, we filter through who we show our true selves to, hoping to be accepted. So we're lying all the time." 

ðŸ‘¤ Joe Goldberg from the series YOU. 


New season of the series in which stalking is romanticized, our social and work life in a single cable that connects everything, online shopping, and location tracking from your mobile, all just one step away. What have we come to? Welcome to the era of technology, 5G, and being an influencer is in fashion.
Since the creation of the internet in the 80s, where everything was frenzied and no one knew what it would be used for. That 2004 where a college boy just wanted to have fun, to this day where we must be "conscious" of the balance between work and personal life.

Pandemic, crisis, remote work, words that were redundant in our mouths from 2019. Social media and media took on a fundamental role, daily the same routine: WhatsApp, LinkedIn, email, Microsoft team or Zoom, TikTok and bed. Downloading apps and games to "waste time." We lost consciousness of its progress, we became routine beings eventually.
To all of this, many are fed off of the routines of others, what are you doing online at this time? Who were you talking to at that hour? You have to turn on the camera to see our faces in meetings, not having the physical space to work in peace, interruptions during lunch or family dinner. To all of this I add that you feel headaches and back pain, you can't sleep, you're tired, you don't want to play with your kids or listen to your partner talk. You feel pressured, to be productive, to have a balance between social and work life, to also train outside of work hours because you don't have time but you know that you are also leaving your family or friends aside, but many times you know that someone is watching over you and judging you.

Now not only do I check if you're online, but I can also see what you're doing outside of work hours. I can see, confirm the time, what you're doing, I can also see your past routines and evaluate from that how much you've changed or evolved. I can know if you're married or single, your sexual orientation, and if you usually go to the same corner to get coffee.
We have asked ourselves if that person is just an image they are creating for a social network, we tend to analyze and judge through a screen. The phrase "appearances are deceiving..." before romanticizing being a stalker and psychoanalyzing others from an image, let's remember that we are humans. But many times we forget, we tend to blind ourselves, is it necessary to know someone's sexual orientation or see if that person went to a bar on Friday night or spent time doing a new training course?.

Remembering a saying, "Be more cautious, appearances are deceiving, even spiders die in their webs."
