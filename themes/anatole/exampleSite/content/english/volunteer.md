My journey has been fueled by a belief that everyone deserves opportunity and the tools to shape their own future. In Buenos Aires, I served as a mathematics educator at **Hogar Casa Liguen**, a home for at-risk children. This experience ignited my passion for empowering vulnerable populations and showed me the transformative power of education.

My belief in building a more inclusive tech landscape led me to **Las de Sistemas** in Argentina. As a speaker and organizer, I advocated for transfeminist women, lesbians, trans, and non-binary individuals, working to create equal opportunities and a supportive environment within the technology sector.

After relocating to Berlin, I found a way to combine my passion for tech and education by mentoring and teaching with **ReDI School of Digital Integration**. Helping newcomers and refugees gain essential digital skills to thrive in their new home has been incredibly rewarding. My dedication to helping others extends to volunteer work with **JACK e.V** and **EinHorn gGmbH**, where I provide support and care to refugee women and children, ensuring a safe and nurturing environment.

***My involvement in various volunteer initiatives dedicated to cybersecurity and the sciences reflects a lifelong curiosity and a desire to make these complex fields accessible to all.***
