Hi there! I’m Araceli Eliana Lopez. At heart, I’m a cybersecurity consultant living in Berlin, originally from Argentina. My journey in the tech world is fueled by a genuine passion for understanding and improving cybersecurity. With four years under my belt, I’ve navigated through various roles that have deepened my knowledge in identifying vulnerabilities, threat modeling, and risk analysis. I’ve been fortunate to work with organizations like DreamLabs Chile & IT Crowd and Port Zero GmbH, among others, where I’ve focused on making digital spaces safer for everyone.

My commitment to cybersecurity extends beyond professional consultancy. I dedicate part of my time to teaching and empowering women in technology, aiming to demystify the field and make it accessible to more diverse voices. I believe in breaking down barriers and building up communities, sharing what I know in a way that’s understandable and engaging. It's about creating a space where learning is shared, and curiosity is encouraged.

This blog is an extension of that commitment—a place to share insights, challenges, and the occasional triumph in the world of cybersecurity. My hope is that it serves as a resource and inspiration for those interested in the field, especially women looking to navigate or advance in technology. It’s a journey we’re on together, learning from each other’s experiences and building a more inclusive tech environment.
